## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vitejs](https://vitejs.dev/) - Compilation tool

### What I learned

I learned how to deploy on GitHub pages using vite, it sounds simple, but I've never done it before since I've always used webpack.

### Continued development

I focus on practicing and reinforcing my knowledge in JS and React.

### Thanks

Thanks for looking at the project, any recommendation is welcome â™¥.
